# JavaScript-Calculator

For this project I was breifed to recreate the iPhone calculator model. I have created a basic JavaScript webpage using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. It performs basic opperations, by using event handlers that are assigned to each button (DOM manipulation) and functions to perform the equations.
